The plaintiff, Ackerman, had claimed that the defendants' film bore too many similarities to his book, but the judge ultimately found no substantial evidence to support this claim.</p><p>According to Reuters, the court ruled that while the film's tone is suspenseful and dramatic, it deviates from the true facts underlying the story and invents an entire KGB subplot. Ackerman's lawyer has stated that he plans to appeal the decision.</p><h2>New Music Release: Lena Raine Shares Songs from Canceled Game</h2><p>Lena Raine, the composer of Celeste's amazing soundtrack, recently shared some songs from the team's cancelled game Earthblade on Bandcamp.
