fans of puzzle games. The company has announced that it will be releasing a new game called Kid Cosmo on March 18th, which is tied to the premiere of another Netflix original series called The Electric State.</p><p>The game itself appears to be a puzzle-based experience, and while not much is known about its specifics, fans are eager to get their hands on it. With Netflix's growing presence in gaming, it will be interesting to see how this venture plays out and whether it becomes a staple for the company's streaming offerings.</p><h2>Nvidia's Latest Hotfix: What Does It Mean for Gamers?</h2><p>Recently, Nvidia released hotfix drivers (v572.65) that aimed to address issues with black screens on RTX 50 GPUs. However, according to an Nvidia support page, the new drivers are essentially the same as the previous release, with a few targeted fixes. This has left many gamers wondering if there's more to this update than meets the eye.</p><p>One thing that's clear is that Nvidia is taking steps to address issues with its high-end graphics cards. While it's not entirely clear what these fixes entail, they could potentially make a significant difference for gamers who have been experiencing problems with their RTX 50 GPUs.</p><h2>The Acquisition of Video Games Deluxe: What's Next for Rockstar Australia?</h2><p>Rockstar Games has announced that it has acquired Video Games Deluxe, a Sydney-based studio that the company previously worked with on re-releases of LA Noire and the GTA trilogy. The new studio will be known as Rockstar Australia, but details about its future projects are scarce.</p><p>This acquisition raises questions about what kind of games we can expect from Rockstar's newly formed Australian arm. While it would be exciting to see more ports of classic games like GTA V, it's also possible that the studio could be working on entirely new titles.</p><h2>The Gaming Tablet Gets a New Lease on Life</h2><p>Apple has recently debuted a trailer for its upcoming anthology series Side Quest, which is based on Mythic Quest. The show appears to focus on standalone episodes separate from the main plot line of the original series.</p><p>Side Quest will be available on Apple TV Plus on March 26th, and fans of Mythic Quest may find themselves drawn to the new series. While it's still early days for this project, we can expect more information about its release and what fans can look forward to in the coming weeks.</p><h2>Games Coming and Going: What's the Latest from Steam's Next Fest 2025?</h2><p>Steam's Next Fest 2025 is underway, offering gamers a chance to try out some of the coolest indie games on the platform. From quirky titles like DQ-themed golf products to more substantial experiences, this festival promises to showcase some truly unique and exciting games.</p><p>As with any major gaming event, there are always going to be games that come and go. This time around, it seems that Super Formation Soccer will be removed from the service on March 28th. While not a huge loss for gamers, it's still another reminder of the ever-changing nature of the gaming landscape.</p><h2>TurboTax Takes Roblox to New Heights: A Look at H&R Block's Gaming Efforts</h2><p>In a bizarre but fascinating move, H&R Block has announced plans to launch Roblox experiences within two other Roblox games. Mega Mansion Tycoon and Club Roblox will both feature the company's tax-related games, including Turbotax.</p><p>At first glance, this partnership may seem like a strange one. However, it highlights the growing importance of gaming in modern life, where people can find all sorts of creative outlets and experiences.</p><h2>A Sampling of Cool Games at Steam's Next Fest 2025</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, Steam's Next Fest 2025 is a great opportunity for gamers to try out some new and exciting titles. From DQ-themed golf products to other quirky indie games, there's something for everyone.</p><p>This festival serves as a reminder that even in the most mundane times of year – like tax season – there are always opportunities to find fun and creative pursuits.</p></div></div><div class="mt-8 flex justify-end"><a href="../../blog" class="group inline-flex items-center gap-2 text-primary font-medium hover:underline">Back to Blog<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-arrow-right h-4 w-4 transition-transform group-hover:translate-x-1"><path d="M5 12h14"></path><path d="m12 5 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div></div></section></main><section class="py-6 flex justify-center relative mx-auto flex max-w-screen-xl"><div class="container"><footer class="page-footer"><div class="mt-20 flex flex-col justify-between gap-4 pt-8 text-center text-sm font-medium text-muted-foreground lg:flex-row lg:items-center lg:text-left"><span>©<!-- --> Autoblogger</span><div class="flex justify-center gap-4 lg:justify-start"><div>&lrm;</div></div></div></footer></div></section></div></div><script src="../../client.js"></script></body></html>
