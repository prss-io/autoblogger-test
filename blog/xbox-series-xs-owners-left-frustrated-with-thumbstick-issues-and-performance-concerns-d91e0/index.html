But the recent thumbstick issues that have been plaguing some owners take the cake. The problem is so widespread that even Microsoft hasn't confirmed whether the update added a limitation to the max range of thumbstick values and a virtual dead zone, which is causing these issues.</p><p>The Xbox Support page describes "Bluetooth connectivity and performance with some older non-Xbox devices" as part of the 5.23.5.0 firmware update. However, owners who have installed this update are now being offered the option to revert it, but that's about it. It seems like Microsoft is leaving a lot of questions unanswered.</p><p>For those who might not be aware, some gamers have been complaining for weeks about thumbstick issues, including loose buttons or sticks that don't move smoothly. I've also noticed some odd behavior with my own Xbox controller, which has me wondering if there's something more going on than just individual hardware problems.</p><p>Battle Beaver Customs, a popular controller customizer, has revealed that the update did indeed add these limitations. However, it's unclear whether this is the root cause of the problem or just a symptom of something deeper. Either way, it's clear that Microsoft needs to do better to support their console and provide more transparency about what's going on.</p><p>On a slightly brighter note, Amazon Prime subscribers can claim games like Saints Row: The Third Remastered, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, Deus Ex: Invisible War, and The Forgotten City this month as part of their subscription. If you're due for a gaming fix, this is definitely worth checking out.</p><p>Meanwhile, uBreakiFix has announced that they will be offering in-person repairs for Xbox Series X/S consoles, starting soon. This is great news for owners who might not want to shell out for a brand new console or deal with the hassle of mail-in repairs.</p><p>Sony is also celebrating the upcoming release of season 2 of The Last of Us on HBO by releasing a new special edition PS5 controller. The controller features TLOU iconography and launches on April 10th – just a few days before the show premieres. While I'm not a huge fan of gaming controllers, this one does sound pretty cool.</p><p>Finally, Split Fiction has launched today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. This new game from Hazelight Studios requires co-op play, which is exactly what it needs to be great. And the best part? The popular Friend Pass program is back, making it easier than ever for you to invite a friend to play with you.</p><p>Split Fiction doesn't need to be original when the co-op play is this good – I've played plenty of games that had solid multiplayer but lacked depth and charm. This game seems like a real winner, and I'm excited to see what the community comes up with.</p><p>In related news, Xbox testers who have installed the latest Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead builds are waking up to consoles that have been reset to default factory settings. Luckily, any games installed locally haven't been wiped – but it's still a bit of a headache to deal with.</p><p>On the bright side, early Alpha builds of Xbox dashboard are often very stable and reliable, so issues like this are incredibly rare. I guess that's something to be thankful for – even if it's not always easy to navigate the inner workings of your console.</p><p>In other gaming news, there's a new magnetic stand that protects joysticks and screens on the Steam Deck. It's thin enough to fit inside the case and unfolds to become a stable stand – dare I say, it sounds like a winner? More information is available if you're interested in learning more.</p></div></section><section class="mb-3"><h4 class="section-title explore-more"><span>Explore More</span></h4><div class=""><div class="card mb-3 d-flex flex-row has-img"><div class="col-2 p-0 explore-featured-image"><a class="card-img-left card-has-img" href="https://prss-io.github.io/autoblogger-test/blog/nvidia-amps-up-gaming-innovation-as-other-giants-struggle-to-keep-pace-17958/"><img src="https://prss-io.github.io/autoblogger-test/assets/images/1e78efcc6b.jpeg" loading="lazy"></a></div><div class="card-body col"><a class="card-title" href="https://prss-io.github.io/autoblogger-test/blog/nvidia-amps-up-gaming-innovation-as-other-giants-struggle-to-keep-pace-17958/">Nvidia Amps Up Gaming Innovation as Other Giants Struggle to Keep Pace</a><p class="card-text">The next generation of Nvidia GPUs is almost here,...</p></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="page-footer"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col col-12 col-md-6"><span>©<!-- --> Autoblogger Test</span></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex justify-content-md-end"><div>&lrm;</div></div></div></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
