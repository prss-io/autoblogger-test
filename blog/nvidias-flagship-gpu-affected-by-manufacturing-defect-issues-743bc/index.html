RTX 5090 card. In a shocking turn of events, reports are emerging that partially defective chips are shipping out to customers, resulting in cards with fewer ROPs (render output units) than expected.</p><h2>What is happening at Nvidia?</h2><p>Nvidia has confirmed to The Verge that a manufacturing defect is leaving "less than 0.5%" of 5090, 5090D, and 5070 Ti chips short on ROPs. However, it appears that the issue runs deeper than initially thought, with some manufacturers such as Zotac, MSI, Gigabyte, Manli, and even an Nvidia Founders Edition card reportedly shipping out cards with missing ROPs.</p><p>This is not the first time we've seen a major GPU manufacturer dealing with quality control issues. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of defective or faulty GPUs from companies such as AMD and Nvidia. However, the fact that this issue is affecting a flagship product like the RTX 5090 makes it all the more concerning.</p><h2>What does this mean for gamers?</h2><p>The impact of this issue on gamers will be significant, especially those who are looking to upgrade their gaming rigs with the latest and greatest hardware. With cards shipping out with fewer ROPs than expected, performance may suffer as a result. This could lead to reduced frame rates, decreased resolution, or even complete system crashes.</p><p>For gamers who have already purchased an RTX 5090 card, it's unclear what steps they can take to resolve the issue. Nvidia has not provided any guidance on how to fix the problem or what support options are available. In the meantime, some manufacturers such as Zotac and MSI are reportedly offering refunds or replacement cards to affected customers.</p><h2>What does this say about Nvidia's quality control?</h2><p>The fact that Nvidia is dealing with a manufacturing defect of this magnitude raises serious questions about the company's quality control processes. It's clear that something went wrong in the production line, and it's only a matter of time before more issues come to light.</p><p>Nvidia has built its reputation on producing high-quality GPUs, but this latest issue threatens to undermine that reputation. As one gamer noted on Reddit, "It looks like Nvidia may have yet another issue with its flagship RTX 5090 card — a noted leaker claims it shipped out partially defective chips with slightly worse performance."</p><h2>What's next for Nvidia?</h2><p>Nvidia has not yet responded to our request for comment on this matter. However, based on the reports that are emerging, it's clear that something needs to be done to address this issue. The company may need to take steps to improve its quality control processes or provide additional support to affected customers.</p><p>In the meantime, gamers can only wait and see how this situation plays out. One thing is certain: Nvidia's reputation will be under scrutiny for some time to come. As one gaming forum user noted, "This is not every card, but reports are coming in of Zotac, MSI, Gigabyte, Manli, and even an Nvidia Founders Edition card with missing ROPs."</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, the latest news surrounding Nvidia's RTX 5090 card is a major concern for gamers. With partially defective chips shipping out to customers, it's clear that something went wrong in the production line. As one gamer noted, "The latest from Life is Strange studio Don’t Nod is a time-spanning adventure about connecting with old friends." But right now, it's all about addressing this latest issue and ensuring that gamers are not left feeling shortchanged.</p><p>As we continue to monitor the situation, we will be sure to provide updates and analysis.
