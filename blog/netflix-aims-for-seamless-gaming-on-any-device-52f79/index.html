This means that users will be able to play Netflix games on any device, without the need for multiple downloads or complicated setup processes.</p><p>Tascan emphasized the importance of reducing friction for gamers, making it easier for them to access and enjoy Netflix games. He cited Fortnite as an example of a successful game that has achieved cross-platform play, which contributed to its massive popularity.</p><h2>Four Categories for Netflix Games</h2><p>Nikeet's gaming strategy will focus on four main categories: narrative games, multiplayer party games, games aimed at kids, and mainstream releases. These categories were chosen because they align with the types of games that Netflix believes will appeal to its existing audience and attract new subscribers.</p><p>Tascan explained that this approach is similar to how Netflix approached original programming in the early days, starting with a few successful shows and gradually expanding its offerings. The goal is to create a one-stop shop for gamers, where they can easily find something new to play.</p><h2>Shifting Focus from AAA Titles</h2><p>As part of this strategy, Netflix will be scaling back its efforts in certain areas, including the development of original AAA titles. Tascan acknowledged that indie games are not typically found on the platform and that Netflix's focus will shift to more niche titles that fit into one of the four categories.</p><p>This shift is a response to the company's earlier attempts at creating AAA games, which were met with limited success. Instead, Netflix will focus on games that offer a unique experience and can be easily integrated into its existing infrastructure.</p><h2>TV-Focused Games Coming Soon</h2><p>Nikeet will soon launch its first TV-focused games, which will be playable via smart TVs and controlled using smartphones. This move aims to reduce the need for game controllers and make gaming more accessible to a broader audience.</p><p>Tascan expressed his hope that some of these new games will create a moment similar to the Travis Scott concert in Fortnite, which became a cultural phenomenon and demonstrated the potential for games to transcend their usual boundaries.</p><h2>Becoming Platform Agnostic</h2><p>The ultimate goal for Nikeet is to become platform agnostic, allowing users to play its games on any device without limitations. Tascan believes that this can be achieved within the next five years, thanks to advancements in streaming technology and a growing global audience.</p><p>This vision of a seamless gaming experience aligns with the principles of platform agnosticism, where users are free to play games across multiple devices without worrying about compatibility issues or restrictions.</p></div></section><section class="mb-3"><h4 class="section-title explore-more"><span>Explore More</span></h4><div class=""><div class="card mb-3 d-flex flex-row has-img"><div class="col-2 p-0 explore-featured-image"><a class="card-img-left card-has-img" href="https://prss-io.github.io/autoblogger-test/blog/eternity-awaits-gaming-news-you-need-to-know-now-24483/"><img src="https://prss-io.github.io/autoblogger-test/assets/images/7b6e6c1916.jpeg" loading="lazy"></a></div><div class="card-body col"><a class="card-title" href="https://prss-io.github.io/autoblogger-test/blog/eternity-awaits-gaming-news-you-need-to-know-now-24483/">Eternity Awaits: Gaming News You Need to Know Now</a><p class="card-text">As a gamer, there&#x27;s nothing quite like the thrill ...</p></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="page-footer"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col col-12 col-md-6"><span>Â©<!-- --> Autoblogger</span></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex justify-content-md-end"><div>&lrm;</div></div></div></div></footer></div></div></body></html>
